The index.html/ home page shows blue flower. though they are not mt favored (because I do not have one) they are very pretty to me. blue is my favorite color and flowers are very calming to me. The about.html/ About Me page talks of my love for the sport basketball and my favorite activity art. it shows a picture of a basketball and art supplies. The last page, the contact.html/ contact page, gives my email so that whoever looks at the website will know how to contact me.
